MULTIPLE CHOICE

1. In the United States, the majority of health care dollars are spent on:
2. a. prescription drugs.
3. b. hospital care.
4. c. physician services.
5. d. public health services (PHSs).

6. ANS: B
7. The largest share of health care expenditures goes to pay for hospital care, with physician services the next largest item. The money spent for PHSs is significantly lower than the other categories of expenditures. Other significant drivers of the increasingly high cost of health care include prescription drugs, technology, and chronic and degenerative disease.

11. 2. The number of uninsured Americans has dramatically increased because:
    3. a. Medicare took over payment of health care costs.
    4. b. with a declining population, the costs for health care rose.
    5. c. nursing salaries greatly increased, causing health care costs to rise.
    6. d. health insurance coverage was dropped from employment-based health plans.
   
    7. ANS: D
    8. Although the majority of Americans continue to obtain health insurance from their employer as a benefit, employment does not guarantee insurance. Employer-sponsored health insurance is sensitive to both the general economy and changes in health insurance premiums. As costs for insurance premiums rose, employers either shifted more of these costs to their employees or declined to offer employment-based health coverage at all. Medicare provides coverage only to the elderly and other special populations. The costs for health care are continuing to rise regardless of the size of the population. There has not been a significant change to nursing salaries, and a change in nursing salaries would not impact the number of uninsured Americans.

    12. 3. A nurse is working with a community to decrease the occurrence of influenza. Which of the following U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS; or simply HHS) goals is being applied?
        4. a. Strengthen Health Care
        5. b. Advance the Health, Safety, and Well-being of the American People
        6. c. Increase Efficiency, Transparency, Accountability, and Effectiveness of HHS Programs
        7. d. Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation
       
        8. ANS: B
        9. One of the objectives of Advance the Health, Safety, and Well-being of the American People is to reduce the occurrence of infectious diseases. The goal of Strengthen Health Care focuses on improving health care services, quality, and coverage. The goal of Increase Efficiency, Transparency, Accountability, and Effectiveness of HHS Programs focuses on improving programming and application of found data. The goal of Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation focuses on scientific discovery and application of the new knowledge.

        13. 4. According to the 1999 Institute of Medicine report, as many as 98,000 deaths each year could be attributed to:
            5. a. cardiovascular disease.
            6. b. obesity.
            7. c. medical error.
            8. d. drug overdose.
           
            9. ANS: C
            10. In 1999 it was thought that our health care system was expensive and that access and quality were not optimal, but we had not considered this important fact: many people die of preventable medical errors in the United States. This number is not the correct statistic for cardiovascular disease, obesity, or drug overdose.

            14. 5. Residents of rural communities report that they must travel for long distances to obtain health care services. As a result, they seek health care only for emergencies and severe illnesses. Which aspect of the health care system in the United States is illustrated in this situation?
                6. a. Access to care
                7. b. Cost
                8. c. Quality
                9. d. Advances in technology
               
                10. ANS: A
                11. One significant problem is poor access to care. Access can refer to inability to pay for care and inability to access care. Cost refers to the health care expenditures that happen to pay for the services received. Quality refers to the quality of health care that is provided. Advances in technology refer to the medical advancements made to treat diseases.

                15. 6. A nurse is exploring a job opportunity at a community health center. Which of the following expectations would the nurse have about the center?
                    7. a. Would be located in a large metropolitan area
                    8. b. Provides care only to the economically disadvantaged
                    9. c. Offers comprehensive primary care services and supportive services
                    10. d. Is used for preventive services such as flu shots
                   
                    11. ANS: C
                    12. Community health centers serve the entire community for primary health care (PHC) services, regardless of income. They are located in a high need or medically underserved community, which can be urban or rural.

                    16. 7. A nursing program has initiated a recruitment campaign focusing on increasing the minority students in its program. Which of the following best describes the rationale for this program?
                        8. a. The number of minority versus non-minority nurses should be equal.
                        9. b. Minority health care professionals who share the same culture with the clients may provide more effective care.
                        10. c. The profession should be more diverse.
                        11. d. Minority nurses can mentor other nurses when providing care for diverse populations.
                       
                        12. ANS: B
                        13. It is thought that increasing minority representation in the health workforce not only is a commitment to diversity, but also will improve the health care delivery system. Minority health professionals can be expected to practice in underserved areas at a greater rate and health professionals who share the same culture and language with the clients they serve can provide more effective care. It has been suggested that the number of minority nurses should be representative of the population served rather than there being equal numbers of minority and nonminority nurses. Minority nurses are able to mentor other nurses; however, is not the main reason that there is a focus on increasing recruitment of minorities.

                        17. 8. A community health nurse is utilizing telehealth. Which of the following best describes the rationale for its use?
                            9. a. Enables clients to get nursing care in their homes
                            10. b. Substitutes for health department delivered care
                            11. c. Improves access to care in rural areas
                            12. d. Replaces face-to-face care for those who cannot afford it
                           
                            13. ANS: C
                            14. Telehealth provides increased access to health care by the use of a computer monitor and telephone line. It is useful for monitoring clients with chronic disease, but is not a substitute for health care. Telehealth may or may not be accompanied by home care nursing.

                            18. 9. One of the goals of the World Health Organization (WHO) is to:
                                10. a. provide PHC services to everyone.
                                11. b. prevent outbreaks of disease.
                                12. c. prevent the transmittal of communicable disease among nations of the world.
                                13. d. provide humanitarian support in times of disaster.
                               
                                14. ANS: A
                                15. The WHO adopted a resolution in 1977 accepting the goal of attaining a level of health that permitted all citizens of the world to live socially and economically productive lives. This has been adapted to meet the needs of the new century and was deemed “Health for All in the 21st Century.” The focus of this initiative is PHC services. The WHO does not prevent outbreaks of disease, prevention, transmittal of disease, or provide humanitarian support.

                                    11. a. Facilitation of interprofessional care
                                    12. b. Improved client compliance with medical regimens
                                    13. c. Cost savings to the agency
                                    14. d. Compliance with the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards
                                   
                                    15. ANS: A
                                    16. The electronic medical record facilitates interprofessional care in chronic disease management and coordination of referrals; 24-hour availability of records with downloaded laboratory results and up-to-date assessments; incorporation of protocol reminders for prevention, screening, and management of chronic disease; improvement of quality measurement and monitoring; and increased client safety and decline in medication errors. There is no data to support that the agency will have improved client compliance or cost savings. Electronic medical records are not a requirement by JCAHO.

                                        17. By definition, PHC includes basic health care services with the emphasis on prevention. Tertiary health care is highly specialized medical care. Public health care focuses on care for populations. Specialized care focuses on only one aspect of a patient’s health.

                                            13. a. The care would be provided by a physician.
                                            14. b. Private insurance would be necessary to receive care.
                                            15. c. The emphasis of care provided would be on prevention.
                                            16. d. A referral would be made to a specialist after receiving services.
                                           
                                            17. ANS: C
                                            18. The focus of PHC is a broad range of services that are designed to be affordable for the recipients of the care and the governments who provide them. The emphasis of care is on prevention and the means of providing the care is based on practical, scientifically sound, culturally appropriate, and socially acceptable methods. All clients can receive PHC services regardless of insurance status. Those receiving primary care services may or may not need referral to a specialist.

PHC emphasizes broad strategies, community participation, self-reliance, and a multidisciplinary health care delivery team; however, this is not the primary method of health care delivery in the United States.

This elderly patient probably is eligible for benefits through Part C, the Medicare Advantage program, but often a patient needs help negotiating the system. The Medicare Advantage program incorporates private insurance plans into the Medicare program including HMO and PPO managed care models and private fee-for-service plans. In addition, Medicare Part D has been added to cover prescriptions. These plans receive payments from Medicare to provide Medicare benefits, including hospital, physician, and often, prescription drug benefits. Finding prescriptive coverage through an insurance plan is a better choice than eliminating medications, trying to get medications for free (which is only a short-term solution in most cases), and telling the client to find a way to pay for the medications when she does not have the resources.
